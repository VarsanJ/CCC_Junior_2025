### Question 1: Pass all test cases (15 points out of 15) (100%)
### Question 2: Pass all test cases (15 points out of 15) (100%)
### Question 3: Pass all test cases (15 points out of 15) (100%)
### Question 4: Exceed time limit for subtask 3 (6 points out of 15) (40%)
### Question 5: Wrong answer for subtask 2 and 3  (3 points out of 15) (20%)

## CUMULATIVE: 54 points out of 75 possible (72%)
Reflecting on my performance, I would have made my code more efficient in question 4 to reduce the time needed. This would have provided 9 points from Question 4. For questio 5, a possible approach would be 2-Dimensional arrays. The code I created fills two arrays based on the specified inputs, then uses loops and conditionals to give the necessary output.
